Heart-Disease-Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics. Using a dataset enriched with patient information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical attributes, the project employs numpy and pandas for data preprocessing and sklearn for model training. The goal is to develop an accurate classification model that can classify patients into high or low-risk categories for heart disease. This predictive capability is crucial for early diagnosis and proactive medical intervention, potentially saving lives by identifying at-risk individuals who may benefit from preventive measures or early treatment strategies.
